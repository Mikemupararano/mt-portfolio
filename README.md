#Mike Thomas's Web Developer Portfolio
## Description 

I showcase my web development work in this repository. The work is a result of spending incredible amounts of hours coding and making sure the code follows modern day standard practice. 

The repository emerged from a deep desire to show my work to other web developers and potential employers. On occasions, I spent approximately 200 hours working on projects offered by freecodecamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).

My projects stand out because I have learnt from many professional developers online and also added my own ideas to write succinct code that is free from error while following modern day practice.
